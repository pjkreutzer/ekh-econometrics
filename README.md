# Econometrics Lab Code for Economic History at LUSEM

This repo contains the Stata do files used in teaching Econometrics I & II at the Economic History Departement Lund University.
The classes are at master level, with computer lab sessions to apply econometric theory using computer software.

To provide students with alternative software options the do files are currently translated to r and python.
